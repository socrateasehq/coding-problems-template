# Introduction

This demo test will explain how you can use our Coding Interface. The objective of the demo is to become familiar with the programming environment, using a very simple problem.

## Process

In an actual test, this section will contain the problem statement. You will read the problem statement and write the appropriate code in the editor on the right. You will then execute the code against Test Cases to see if it is working. If it is, you will Submit the code.

## Test Cases

Our programming tests are automatically evaluated. To test if your code is correct, we execute your code against a set of inputs. These are called **test cases**. Because we have set up the test cases, we know what output to expect. If your code generates the same output as the expected output, we will mark your code as correct. Else, it is wrong.

### Sample Test Cases

The actual test cases we will run our code against isn't known to you. But, we have a few sample input and expected outputs listed here. As you write the code, you can run tests to see what output you are getting. This will help you debug the code. Once you are confident that your code is correct, you may submit the code. Your code submission is final, and you can't make any changes after that.

# Problem

## Statement

Given a string `s`, you must return the first character of the string. You are guaranteed that the string has at least one character. Don't change the name of the `main` function on the right. You may write other code inside and outside the function.

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output |
| ----- | --------------- |
| abc   | a               |
| 123   | 1               |
| s     | s               |
