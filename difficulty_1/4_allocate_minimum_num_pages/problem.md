# Ordering a List of Integers

`unique_ints` is an array of Integers. There are no repeating integers in `unique_ints`. A function `f(x,y)` acting on two elements in the list moves `x` to `y`'s position and `y` to `x`'s position. What is the least number of times you can call `f` so that the resulting array is in ascending order?

### Example 1

**Input:** 2 8 5 4

**Output:**
1

**Explanation:** Swap 8 with 4.

### Example 2

**Input:** 10 19 6 3 5

**Output:**
2

**Explanation:** Swap 10 with 3 and swap 19 with 5.
